Simple E-commerce Cart:

Features:

Display a list of products (with images, prices, descriptions).

"Add to Cart" button for each product.

Shopping cart component:

Display items in the cart.

Increase/decrease quantity of items.

Remove items from the cart.

Calculate the total price.

Persist the cart data in localStorage.

Focus: Complex state management (managing the cart), passing data between components, updating state based on user actions, using localStorage effectively.

Expansion: Implement a checkout process (doesn't need to be fully functional â€“ just a form), handle shipping costs, apply discounts.
